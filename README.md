# Statistics_by_Python_test_and_distribution_fit_etc

- Weibull probability plot together with Mann-Whitney U test to know statistical diffrence between distributions
- Lognormal distribution parameters fit giving characteristic points (0.01, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.99 percentiles)
- Chi square test
- t-test
- outlier detection with higher confidence using several outlier detection algorithms and thresholds
